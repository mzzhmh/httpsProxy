1. app.py is the http to https Restful proxy (python Flask) that gets the http Restful requests from the upper stream monitoring platform. 
Then the proxy transforms the http requests to https requests and send the https restful requests to the Tesla powerwall to get the status 
data of the powerwall. Then the restful proxy sends back the status data to upper stream platform via restful http responses.

2. The app.py restful proxy is containerized by the docker. dockerfile is used for building the base image for the python proxy container
and docker-compose.yml is used for deploy multiple instances of the https restful proxy.

3. The Jenkinsfile is used for achieving the single click deployment for CD/CI purpose and it is used for non-linux backgroud staff to do 
the quick deployment.
